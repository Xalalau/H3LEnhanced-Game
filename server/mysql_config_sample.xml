<!--
	This file defines MySQL configuration data.
	This is a sample of the file used for MySQL configurations. The default file used by servers is named default_mysql_config.txt.
	Copy this file and rename it to that to use the default settings.

	To use another configuration file, set the as_mysql_config cvar to the path and name of the file, including the extension.
	E.g. The default file is set to server/default_mysql_config.txt


	This defines the default configuration for MySQL connections made by scripts.
	This is only an example and will not work on any servers that have been properly configured.
	If it does work, please configure your MySQL server correctly.
